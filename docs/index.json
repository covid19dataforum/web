In 1997, he became the first statistician to be named a Bell Labs Fellow, cited for ``pioneering contributions to the field of statistical computing\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;. His research has touched on nearly all aspects of computing with data but he is best known for the design (and continuing re-design) of the S language and its successor, R.

Particularly steps that could be taken fairly directly now.\n3- More ambitiously, looking for ways to make sharing and extending more effective, perhaps by adopting some shared standards or interfaces among existing software and data structures.\nA natural question is: \u0026ldquo;Why a Data Forum? Are data-specific questions important enough for this attention?\u0026rdquo; We strongly believe so.\nData questions arise in a scientific study at three broad stages.\n  First, obtaining the data. How does what you record relate to what you wanted to record? There will be errors, usually, but even more the observed quantity may not be what you would really like to record. Variations over geography or time may be important. Combining data of different domains (e.g., public health combined with economic data) raises key consistency questions.\n  The second stage is using the data for analysis and modeling. One particular aspect not always appreciated is the importance of matching the software structure provided with the valid scientific meaning of the data. The analyst needs to express meaningful operations on the data naturally. But at least as important \u0026mdash; the structure should prevent, or at least make unintuitive, operations that produce meaningless combinations from the data. (A whole chapter on the data frame as a structure possible here!)\n  Then, the key third stage: communicating about the data, often augmented by results of models or other analysis. The key challenge is to produce interpretable, clear visualizations or other summaries, without distortions or implications not supported by the actual results. Perhaps the most challenging of all the data-related operations.\n  Our prediction, fairly confidently, is that today\u0026rsquo;s session and future discussions will bring out important examples of these and other data-based aspects of our response to this challenge.\n","permalink":"/meetings/1st_meeting/","tags":["Overview","Intro"],"title":"Intro to the first meeting"},{"categories":["Past Event"],"contents":"The first COVID-19 Data Forum, co-sponsored by the Stanford Data Science Institute and the R Consortium, was held May 14, 2020.
