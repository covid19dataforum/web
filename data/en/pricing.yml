  content : "COVID-19 spreads by close contact between individuals,
  and around the world control efforts have focused on reducing
  human-to-human contact by “social distancing” and “stay-at-home”
  policies. Despite the central role of human movement and contact in
  the pandemic, it remains extremely challenging to infer the past
  route of virus spread, forecast future transmission pathways, or
  monitor the reduction in person-to-person contacts in response to
  policies. Large-scale human mobility data has emerged as a novel
  data source to approximate human contact. This data is now being
  produced by telecommunications companies, smartphone manufacturers,
  social media platforms, transit agencies, and more, and analyzed by
  researchers across domains.\n\nThis public webinar and discussion will focus on the key challenges
and opportunities for mobility data, including data access, privacy
concerns, biases, similarities and differences between sources, and
the utility for modeling and public health decision making. The event
will be open to the public, and is part of a continuing series
focusing on data-related aspects of the scientific response to the
pandemic.
