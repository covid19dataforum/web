# Mobility data in monitoring and forecasting COVID-19
_December 10, 2020_

The third public COVID-19 Data Forum event, which was held on December 10th, 2020, examined the promises and challenges of large-scale human mobility data, and the diversity of ways itâ€™s used to understand SARS-CoV-2 spread and the behavioral/policy responses to the pandemic. The event featured three expert speakers working on different aspects of mobile data: Dr. Caroline Buckee at Harvard, Dr. Luca Ferretti at Oxford, and Dr Andrew Schoeder of Direct Relief. Dr. Chris Volinsky of AT&T Research, moderated the event and guided the open forum discussion. Over 150 people attended the event.
