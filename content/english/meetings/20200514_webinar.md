The first COVID-19 Data Forum, co-sponsored by the Stanford Data Science Institute and the R Consortium, was held May 14, 2020. The forum used Zoom as a way to connect remote specialists, present information, and conduct a Q&A session so that participants could ask questions and give opinions.

Close to 200 people attended, watching a range of experts cover a level of detail around COVID-19 that is not available through newspapers, and asking questions covering science and policy.
