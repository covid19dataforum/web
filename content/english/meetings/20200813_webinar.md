# Beyond case counts: Making COVID-19 clinical data available and useful
_August 13, 2020_

The second public COVID-19 Data Forum event, which was held on August 13th, 2020 looked beyond the COVID-19 case count data so ubiquitous in public media coverage, and focused on the challenges faced in making COVID-19 clinical data available and useful to physicians, scientists and public health officials. The event featured four expert speakers working on different aspects of clinical data: Dr. Jenna Reps of OHDSI, Dr. Andrea Ganna of the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, Dr Ken Massey of Soma Technologies and Dr. Roni Rosenfeld CMU professor of computer science. Dr Sherri Rose, Stanford Associate Professor of Health Policy, moderated the event and guided the open forum discussion. Over one hundred and twenty-five people attended the event.
