John Chambers was a member of Bell Labs research from 1966 until his retirement in 2005. In 1997, he became the first statistician to be named a Bell Labs Fellow, cited for ``pioneering contributions to the field of statistical computing''. His research has touched on nearly all aspects of computing with data but he is best known for the design (and continuing re-design) of the S language and its successor, R. Since 2008, he has been Consulting Professor, Department of Statistics, Stanford University.
